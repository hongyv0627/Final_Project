# Final_Project

Special Instructions for running my code:

Before running the code, you need to apply API keys for Google Places API as well as Yelp Fusion API, put them in a python file named secrets.py as variables, 
and name the variables as GOOGLE_API_KEY and YELP_API_KEY respectively. In order to help SI507 Professors and GSIs easier to check my code, I will upload the secrets.py
along with my final project submission pdf file when I submit the Final Project Submission assignment in Canvas.

A brief description of how to interact with my program.
The program is designated to check the google ratings and yelp ratings of a specific fast food brand's restaurants in a specific city.
Users can enter their interested fast food brand name and enter their interested city name. The program will return most of (but not all) the restaurants' google rating 
and yelp rating of the brand in that city. The ratings data will be displayed in different kinds of plots, including histograms and scatter plots,
and users can choose which plot do they want to look at.
